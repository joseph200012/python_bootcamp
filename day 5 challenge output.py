Write a program to create a list of n integer values and do the following:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]
Add an item in to the list (using function):
Delete (using function):
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]
Store the largest number from the list to a variable:
51
Store the Smallest number from the list to a variable:
0
Create a tuple and print the reverse of the created tuple:
(11, 12, 13, 14, 15)
(15, 14, 13, 12, 11)
Create a tuple and convert tuple into list:
(16, 17, 18, 19, 20)
[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
